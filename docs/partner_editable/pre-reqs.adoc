==== Prepare your AWS account

You need to be signed in as an administrator (IAM User or Role with `AdministratorAccess` policy attached, or the AWS root user) into an AWS Account. This account must not be a member of an AWS Organization.

==== Prepare for the deployment

The superwerker quickstart works best with a dedicated DNS subdomain, so it can handle email inboxes of created AWS sub-accounts securely.

You will be asked to provide a domain (e.g. `mycompany.com`) and subdomain (e.g. `aws`) for a DNS zone which superwerker creates. You can choose those freely. The installation will provide you with `NS` entries for this newly created DNS zone. You have to create an `NS` entry within your DNS provider so that the DNS zone is delegated (these records will be made available at a later point in the so called "living documentation"). The superwerker installation will wait until the delegation is properly configured.
