This Quick Start provides two deployment options:

* Deploy {partner-product-short-name} at once: All features are enabled by default and will be installed.
* Deploy {partner-product-short-name} iteratively with feature flippers: recommended if you only want to use certain features or you want to test the impact of particular features.
