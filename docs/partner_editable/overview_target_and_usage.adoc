This guide provides instructions for deploying the {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start reference architecture on the AWS Cloud.

This Quick Start is for users who want to quickly get started with the AWS Cloud with preconceived decisions based on years of experience. Start-ups and small to medium-sized companies, where time-to-market and financial aspects play an especially important role, can benefit in particular.

As a rule of thumb: if you have no dedicated AWS team or cloud centre of excellence in-house, you should use superwerker.

But also large companies can use superwerker as a basis. Since superwerker is open source, it can also be tailored to individual needs.
